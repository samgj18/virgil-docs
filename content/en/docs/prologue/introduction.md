## Get started

There are two main ways to get started with Virgil depending on your Effect System of choice:

### ZIO 2.x

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "io.kaizen-solutions" %% "virgil-zio" % "1.0.2"
```

### Cats Effect 3.x

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "io.kaizen-solutions" %% "virgil-cats-effect" % "1.0.2"
```

### Alternative

To integrate another effect system (or runtime), depend on the core module and reference the implementations for ZIO & Cats Effect

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "io.kaizen-solutions" %% "virgil-core" % "1.0.2"
```
